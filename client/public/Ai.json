    "content": "The cytoskeleton is a dynamic network of protein fibers that provides structural support, facilitates cell movement, and plays a crucial role in cell division. It is composed of three main types of fibers: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.  Microfilaments, the thinnest fibers, are made of the protein actin and are involved in cell movement, muscle contraction, and maintaining cell shape. Intermediate filaments are strong, fibrous proteins that provide mechanical support and anchor organelles.  Microtubules, the thickest fibers, are hollow tubes made of tubulin and function in cell division, providing tracks for vesicle movement, and forming structures like flagella and cilia. Flagella are long, whip-like structures used for cell locomotion, while cilia are shorter, hair-like structures involved in movement or moving substances along the cell surface.  The coordinated interplay of these cytoskeletal elements is essential for a wide range of cellular processes."
